# Publicatii-ESTIC2021

These are the ***original*** source files written by me and my friend as part of our submission to the ESTIC2021 contest.
This project not only was a wonderful learning experience, but also landed us second place.

This is a reminder to everyone that no matter what happens, there will always be people out there who care about you and who can be counted on to be there when you need them.
They are called ***friends***.

Here's to one of the best friends I've ever had, the person who changed my life foreverðŸ¥‚.
